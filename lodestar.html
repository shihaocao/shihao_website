								<!-- <h3>Extra Details</h3>
								<p>Together with a partner, we designed and built an electric VTOL drone with single point
								vectored thrust. It delivers weighs about one kg, and can hover vertically. I designed the
								vehicle and wrote the C++ flight software, and my partner did the testing and GNC code.
								</p> -->
								<!-- <hr/> -->

								<h3>Introduction</h3>
								<p>
								Lodestar is a small scale electric vertical takeoff
								and landing (VTOL capable) project that I worked
								on with Govind Chari over the 2020 Summer. I
								was in Hawthorne, so I designed the craft and
								wrote the flight software. My partner Govind built
								and tested the vehicle, and also wrote the GNC
								code. By the end of the summer, the vehicle
								could perform a takeoff and land vertically.
								The objective was to understand the challenges
								in creating a vehicle that could take off and land
								vertically through thrust vectoring only similar to
								the Falcon 9.
								</p>
								<hr/>

								<h3>Years Before</h3>
								<p>
									The first attempts at this project, actually started back in 2017
									before I had even met Govind. Together with Matthew Cox, and Jude Bedessem,
									we studied how to build a similar system for recovery of high power rockets.

									While they worked on the rocketry side of the project, I lead the way on the
									recovery side with two pathfinder vehicles for an electric motor vertical landing
									system.
								</p>

								<h3>Pathfinder 1 - EDF Thrust Vectoring</h3>
								<p>This initial pathfinder taught me how to build a thurst vectoring actuators, and
									I was also able to test using an EDF as a main power system. I realized that the torque
									delivered from the motor needed significant compensation. Further that an EDF sized system
									was too large and heavy for safe prototyping. This drove me to target a lighter smaller system on the next iteration.
								</p>

								<h3>Pathfinder 2 - Counter Rotating Props and Active Control</h3>
								<p>On this iteration, I tested using a commercial flight computer the Pixhawk 4, and two counter rotating
									propellers. This also used a similar fin based thrust vectoring system. In the picture below, you'll
									see it hanging from strings as a partial free-hanging system to test roll control. A system I would repeat
									for Lodestar.

								<h3>Lodestar Design</h3>
								<p>
								Using lessons learned from my past designs, the bill of materials and overall system design (mass budget, power budget,...) 
								was very easy to get right on the first try.
							  I I chose to use two
								counter-rotating quadcopter motors to cancel
								torque and ensure centerline thrust. Roll control
								on the craft is achieved through differential thrust,
								and pitch & yaw is achieved through thrust
								vectoring vanes actuated by servos inside the
								thrust structure. The two motors have seperate power systems, and one of them also powers the avionics stack.
								</p>
								<hr/>

								<h3>Flight Software and Ground Software</h3>
								<p>
								Flight software on this vehicle was derived from the flight software on PAN (my satellite team). This gave the
								fine grained control that I did not have from previous commerical flight computers. I
								wrote all code to parse orientation and position data from the onboard IMU and Barometer. I
								wrote a mission manager state machine that guided the craft through sensor initialization, flight,
								and post-landing. To aid with initial development, I also developed a custom NodeJS based web
								ground station. I also wrote all the boilerplate code that my partner plugged into for guidance,
								navigation, and control.
								</p>

								<p>Here's the link to the <a href="https://github.com/shihaocao/lodestar">repository</a> for Lodestar.</p>
								<hr/>

								<h3>Iteration</h3>
								<p>
								I worked with my partner to develop an
								iterated testing campaign that would guide us to full mission success. We created a
								Matlab simulation that verified simple attitude control PID loops. We then built the craft and did
								thrust testing to verify that it was capable of a greater than one thrust to weight ratio. To aid in development,
								and figuring out why flight failures happen, I added SD-card datalogging for post-flight analysis.
								</p>
								<hr/>

								<h3>Roll Control</h3>
								We verified the full control loop from sensors to actuators by only allowing freedom in the roll axis,
								and verifying that the craft could maintain a steady roll angle. 
								</p>
								<hr/>

								<h3>Final Flights</h3>
								<p>
								After lots of testing and a few total rebuilds of the vehicle, we finally got Lodestar to perform a vertical
								takeoff and landing after the 23rd test flight.
